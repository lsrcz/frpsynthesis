;; In the discrete time model, a stream is represented by a list.
;; Each element in the list represents a tick of the clock.
;; At each timestep, either an event happens, or an event does not happen.
;; If an event occurs at some timestep t, the list stores a value corresponding to the event
;; at the t position of the list.
;; If no event occurs at time t, then a special symbol is stored at the t position of the list
